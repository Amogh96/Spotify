# Spotify
##Regression Problem
#Spotify is one of the largest music streaming service providers, which is currently extremly popular amongst music enthusiasts. The dataset used for the Regression problem is the adapted Spotify playlist dataset.
In this Dataset we are finding a machine learning model using regression that will be able to predict future instances based on the attributes associated with the training dataset. The dataset used here is a collection of songs and attributes based on a larger dataset collected from a Spotify playlist. Our goal in this assignment is to explore the dataset, gain insights into which attributes will be the most useful, and to build a regression model capable of prediction. This will be followed by our findings and potential future work that we feel would be useful in improving the predications for this regression problem.

##Classification Problem
#Spotify is one of the largest music streaming service providers, which is currently extremly popular amongst music enthusiasts. We are building a classification model that can identify whether a song belongs to a particular genre. The dataset used for the classification problem is the adapted Spotify playlist dataset.

Our notebook shows how a typical classification problem can be handled. We start by exploring the data, understanding the data, preparing the data, and visualising the distributions of features. We have also checked the correlations between the features using a heatmap and the multicollinearity using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF). Then we moved on to using Logistic Regression, a Random Forest classifier, Decision Tree classifier, and a Support Vector Classifier to check and compare their performance.
